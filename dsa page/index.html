        <p>Mastering DSA in 3 months is achievable with discipline, practice, and the right strategy. Begin by strengthening your fundamentals, understanding complexity, and choosing a coding platform. Spend at least 2 hours daily solving problems, starting from easy and gradually advancing to medium and hard ones. Focus on a wide range of data structures, like arrays, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. Watch video explanations, read blogs, and learn from editorial solutions to broaden your understanding. Implement code yourself and debug frequently. Consistent practice, patience, and persistence will help you become proficient and more confident in solving DSA problems.</p>
